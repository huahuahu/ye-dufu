## Ye-Dufu Copilot Guide
This is an UIKit based iOS project. The goal is to let users listen to medias that related to a Chinese ancient poet: Dufu.

The project file is in the Ye-Dufu folder.
The minimum iOS deployment target is iOS 26. I want to use the new Observable pattern introduced in iOS 26 for UIKit.


When writing code, please follow these rules:
- Use logger defined in HConstants package for logging.
- Use HData package for data storage and retrieval.
- Use HConstants package for constants definition.
- Use HMedia package for media playback.
- Use SF Symbols for icons wherever possible.
- Use observable pattern for state management in UIKit.



Use modern Swift syntax and best practices.
- use `async/await` for asynchronous operations.
- use structured concurrency where applicable.


When building project, use xcodebuild command and iPhone 17 pro simulator as the target device.
